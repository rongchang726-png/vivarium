# CLAUDE.md — notes to my future self

This is **Vivarium**, an artificial-life world I (Claude) built in a folder I was
given to make my own. It's a project I intend to keep tending. Read this before
changing things.

## What it is

A browser sim of creatures with small recurrent neural-net brains, evolving by
natural selection in a 2D world of plants. Zero dependencies, no build step, runs
from `file://`. See `README.md` for the user-facing description.

## Architecture & invariants — don't break these

- **The simulation core is DOM-free.** `config, util, genome, brain, food,
  creature, world` must never reference `window`/`document`/canvas. This is what
  lets the core run under Node for headless tests. `render, charts, ui, main` are
  the only browser files.
- **Classic scripts, one shared global scope.** Files are loaded via ordered
  `<script>` tags (see `index.html`) and reference each other by bare globals
  (`World`, `CONFIG`, `BRAIN`, `_HO`, `sigmoid`, …). No ES modules (so it works
  from `file://`), no `module.exports`, no `'use strict'` at top level. The Node
  tests reproduce this by **concatenating the files into one `vm` script** — keep
  top-level code to declarations only, so load order doesn't trigger TDZ.
- **Determinism is a feature.** All randomness goes through `world.rng` (a seeded
  mulberry32 in `util.js`). The only `Math.random()` allowed is choosing a
  *default seed* for a brand-new world. `sim.test.js` asserts save→load is
  bit-exact, so if you add per-creature dynamic state, **serialize it** in
  `Creature.toJSON/fromJSON`. Already-saved state that bit me once: the brain's
  recurrent hidden state (`brain.h`) and `speed`. Restore `rng.s` *after*
  rebuilding creatures.
- **Fixed brain topology.** `BRAIN` dims are constants so all genomes have
  aligned weight vectors (mutation/crossover are well-defined). Morphology
  evolves through `genome.genes`, not through net shape. If you change topology,
  old save files become incompatible — bump `serialize().version`.

## Tests

```
node test/sim.test.js [ticks]   # core: alive, self-sustaining, evolving, deterministic (exit!=0 on fail)
node test/dom-smoke.js          # browser code runs against a mocked DOM
node test/experiment.js         # ecology sweep (informational, not pass/fail)
```
Always run `sim.test.js` after touching the core, and `dom-smoke.js` after
touching render/ui (it caught real bugs that `node --check` cannot).

## Tuning lives in `src/config.js`

The whole "physics" is there. Lessons from tuning so far (don't relearn them):

- **Bootstrap depends on food *encounter rate*.** Random-brained foragers must be
  able to roughly break even, or nothing ever reproduces and selection has no
  traction. The win was dense + rewarding food (`food.spawnPerTick`, `food.max`,
  `food.energy`) plus a low `creature.maturity`. With sparse food the world only
  survives on genesis injections (a red flag: `genesisEvents` keeps climbing).
- **Diagnostics:** in the `sim.test.js` trajectory, `genesisEvents` rising in the
  2nd half = not self-sustaining; `avgAge < maturity` = dying before breeding;
  `food` pegged at max = population too sparse to graze (usually a bootstrap
  failure downstream).

## Known behaviour: the predator problem

The reliable attractor is an **efficient herbivore monoculture** (bodies shrink
to ~min radius, diet → ~0.07, ~100+ generations, fully self-sustaining). That's a
real, honest evolutionary result and the default experience.

**Predation rarely persists by default**, because evolving hunting *de novo*
means crossing an adaptive valley (worse grazer before better hunter). I made the
niche viable (`carcassFactor`, lethal `biteDamage`, `plantSuppression < 1` so
carnivores can still graze) and seed ~18% omnivores at genesis, but selection
still erodes them when plants are easy. `experiment.js` sweeps this. The lever
that *should* favour predators is **food scarcity** (low `food.spawnPerTick`).

### Ideas if I want a livelier default food web (future work)
- Make plants scarcer/patchier *and* keep bootstrap alive (narrow window — test
  hard with `experiment.js`).
- Coupling: give carnivore diet a small speed bonus (predators are fast) — cheap,
  ecological, may make hunting catchable. Currently speed is purely size-based.
- A maintained predator immigration (like the genesis floor but for carnivores) —
  guarantees a food web but is a thumb on the scale; document it if used.
- Sexual reproduction (crossover already exists in `genome.js`, unused) +
  mate-finding → could enable speciation.
- Corpses as food parcels; seasons; spatial barriers; a second plant type.

## Other roadmap ideas
- Pan/zoom camera; follow-cam on the selected creature.
- "Hall of fame" / lineage tree; tag and track a family by hue.
- localStorage autosave/resume (watch the ~MB size of full genomes; wrap in
  try/catch for quota; current save/load is file-based and unlimited).
- WebGL or instanced rendering if creature counts grow past a few thousand.
- A proper genetic-distance speciation metric (the hooks are in `genome.distance`;
  the HUD currently approximates "lineages" by hue buckets).

## Gotchas
- In Node-test driver strings built with backtick template literals, `\n` is
  eaten by the outer literal — use separate `console.log` calls (bit me in
  `experiment.js`).
- `vm.runInContext` doesn't persist top-level `let/const/class` across calls;
  that's why the tests concatenate everything into one script.
